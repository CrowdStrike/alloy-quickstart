# alloy-quickstart

_Opinionated building blocks for robust Foundry apps._

## Support

This repository is an open source project, not a CrowdStrike product. As such, it carries no formal support, expressed or implied.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
1. Remove our git history: `rm -rf .git`
1. Build the UI: `cd ui && npm install && npm run build`
1. Deploy the app: `mv manifest.new.yml manifest.yml && foundry apps deploy`

## UI (extensions and pages)

Unlike the content generated by the Foundry CLI, which creates a new NPM project for every extension and page, we create a single NPM project for _all_ extensions and pages:

```
ui/
  public/
    index.html      Template for all built HTML files (entrypoint for extensions and pages)
  src/
    components/     (Optional) React components reusable across all pages and extensions
    lib/            (Optional) Libraries reusable across all pages and extensions
    apps/           Contains a subdirectory for each extension or page
```

At build time, a separate HTML file and JavaScript bundle is created for each page and extension. Each subdirectory of `apps` is treated the same, whether it's an extension or a page. By convention, we'll create a `pages` directory for a multi-page app. Any other naming is up to you.

Extensions and pages are built using [alloy-react](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/alloy-react), which provides [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/).
